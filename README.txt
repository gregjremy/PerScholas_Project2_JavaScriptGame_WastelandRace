Wasteland Race is a simple game based on the Candyland board game

Wasteland Race(will be abbreviated to WR) 'rolls' a 'die'(random number generator) to move players along a 'path'(blocks of divs). Player 
Objects have a "playerPosition" attribute that starts at 0 and adds the number rolled to that payers playerPosition. Once a player's 
playerPosition counter is greater than the number of the final block(33), that player wins and the game is over.

It isn't anywhere near being the finished product that I visualize. Even though the game logic is solid and functional, the game still only
exists in the console. Currently the user experience is nonexistent. In the future I intend to get the HTML and CSS running. Also I would 
like to implement a system of player "traits" that would modify the gameplay based on the trait selected in the pregame setup.
